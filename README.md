1. Copy the contents of each file in "resources/" to its corresponding Cura Configuration Folder. You may need to create the folder You can find this under 'Help > Show Configuration Folder'
2. Download the GXWriter plugin from the link below
3. Launch Cura and add the "Creator Pro 2" printer
4. Go to "Extensions -> Post Processing -> Modify G-Code", then select "Creator Pro 2 Temperature Fix" to ensure temperatures are correctly applied in dual-extrusion modes

### Plugins:

| file extension | file format      | Cura marketplace | source code |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| .gx            | `application/gx` | [GXWriter plugin](https://marketplace.ultimaker.com/app/cura/plugins/Ronoaldo/GXWriter) | [GXWriter github](https://github.com/ronoaldo/FlashforgeFinderIntegration/tree/master/plugins/GXWriter) |
